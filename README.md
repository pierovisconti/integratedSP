# All input files to run the spatial conservation analyses in Marxan with zones are available from here https://zenodo.org/deposit/5594628
# For information on the software and the usage of the input file please refer to the Marxan with Zones user manual from https://marxansolutions.org/
# Place all files except those starting with input in an input folder. Place the input folder and the decompressed output folder and the inpupt files in the same directory with the Marxan executables. 
#the output folder contains all Marxan outputs as used in the article  "Integrated spatial planning for biodiversity conservation and food production"
# to run Marxan, download the executable from https://marxansolutions.org/ place it in the same directory where the input directory is together with the relevant input.dat file e.g. inputILUP.dat and from the shell navigate where the executable and the input file are and and execute this command marxan.exe inputILUP.dat
# once Marxan has finished running you can run the rscript to retrieve all outputs and reproduce figure 2 of the manuscript
